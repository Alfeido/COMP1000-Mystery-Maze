# COMP1000-Mystery-Maze

For my first Module the majority of marks were split between 2 assignments worth 30% and 70% of the module grade. The first 30% was mostly c++ practices that built up an understanding of the language. 
This is the 70% submission that is a mystery maze that demonstrates an understanding with 2 dimensional arrays.

The maze works where you enter W for up, A for left, S for down and D for right. Press the desired direction and hit enter to submit and the game will update. 

The [P] is the player.

The [X] are the walls.

The [E] is the exit.

The [M] is the map that will reveal the exit.

the [Z] are zombies that will chase you if they see you.

Each maze you have one drill charge, this allows you to break one wall or kill one zombie, try to not use it for a higher score.
